An interactive map to display refugee data

## Dev env setup

If you have a Mac, just running `make` should:

* install PgSQL (from http://postgresapp.com/), and launch it
* install [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* install the required python eggs inside that virtual env
* launch Django's built-in dev web server on port 8000

If you have another OS, you're out of luck...
